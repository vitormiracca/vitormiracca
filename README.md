<h3 align="left">About Me:</h3>

Currently working as an Analytics Engineer, in a Business Intelligence team in the Brazilian financial market.<br>
I'm passionate about technology, especially when we're talking about data and systems development.<br><br>
Recently I've been seeking improvement in Data Engineering techniques, such as good ETL practices, cloud storage and distribution, distributed processing systems, among others...<br>
In my free time, sometimes I develop some simple systems and data analysis for my day-to-day life. It’s an enjoyable practice and also contributes to my professional development.<br><br>
In this environment, I share some of my personal projects, studies and even some simple tests.
